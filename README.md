🚴‍♂️ Analyzing London Bike Rides: Python + Tableau 📊

I recently worked on a data analysis project to explore bike usage trends in London, leveraging Python (Jupyter Notebook) for data preprocessing and Tableau for interactive visualization.

Key Highlights:
1️⃣ Total Rides: Over 1.55 million bike rides were recorded between January 4, 2015, and March 20, 2015.

2️⃣ 10-Day Moving Average: A time-series analysis revealed significant fluctuations in bike usage, highlighting seasonal and weather-driven trends.

3️⃣ Weather Impact (Heatmap): A detailed heatmap showed the relationship between temperature and wind speed, revealing that moderate temperatures (5–15°C) and low wind speeds (0–20 kph) saw the highest bike usage. Extreme weather conditions had a noticeable impact on ridership.


Tools & Skills:
🔹 Python (Jupyter): Data cleaning, aggregation, and generating insights like moving averages.
🔹 Tableau: Interactive dashboard creation for trend analysis and visualization of weather impact on bike usage.

This project gave me hands-on experience in combining data engineering and visualization to derive actionable insights. It also highlights the importance of leveraging data for smarter urban mobility planning.
Feel free to check out the dashboard for a deeper dive! 🚴‍♀️✨
